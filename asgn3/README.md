Controls:================================
MOVEMENT KEYS:
WASD

CAMERA ROTATION: 
Q, E, MOUSE

ADD BLOCK: "1"
DELETE BLOCK: "2"

EAT CHEESE: "R"

Overhead POV: see whole map and control the rat
First POV: switch to the camera that's kind of like a third person over the rat no matter where it's moved on the map
RESTART: reset all positions to the original placements, restarts timer and score.

ABOUT THE "GAME" ===========================
You are controlling this rat, navigate and break through the walls to collect cheese. 
You can only break through walls when in First POV mode or the starting mode.
Collect all the cheese on the board with "R" as fast as possible.
There are 5 cheeses and there is a leaderboard at the bottom. There are always 5 cheeses and the challenge is that sometimes it's not visible on the overhead map by being hidden by the surropunding terrain.
When in First POV mode, you can adjust the camera and add/delete blocks as long as the rat is positioned about a cube away from the one you want to target.
 

NOTES:
had PC issues and had to borrow different device to make progress
my cell selections are imperfect and may require repositioning but everything really does work as intended. IF the FPOV shows the inside of a wall, hit "A" until you see the rat is a usual case I found.
